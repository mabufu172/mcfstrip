# mcfstrip
Remove spaces and comments from every .mcfunction files in your chosen datapack folder. (yes it's pointless)

## 📦 Requirements
- Node.js
- A datapack folder

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone this repo or Download as zip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mabufu172/mcfstrip.git
```
> **Note:** downloading **index.js** folder alone is enough as its the only thing you need.
2. Make a backup of your datapack folder just to be safe
3. Move `index.js` to your datapack folder (alongside `pack.mcmeta`)
4. Run the program:
```bash
node .
```

I have no idea why I made this years ago, but I hope someone (no one) find it useful!
